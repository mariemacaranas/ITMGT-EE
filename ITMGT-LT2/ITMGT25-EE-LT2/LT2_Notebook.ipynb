    "The dataset consists of 24 columns containing various data related to housing in the different regions in the Philippines. Some of the column titles have a vague description of what the numbers are supposed to mean for example, the column 'Total Value' does not indicate what it is a total value of. The arrangement of the columns also increased the difficulty to understand the data and thus, it is challenging to analyze the given data set. If I were to clean this, I would rearrange the columns in order for the data set to be reader-friendly as the data will become easier to understand. Most of the data are also numerical data therefore the columm titles should also contain the proper units for the numbers. Aside from this, all the columns without any data/missing data should be removed.  \n",
